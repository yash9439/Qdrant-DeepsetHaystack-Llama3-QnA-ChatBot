      " That being said there are some pre-built binaries available through the Releases as well as some community provided wheels. \n",
      " In the future, I would like to provide pre-built binaries and wheels for common platforms and I'm happy to accept any useful contributions in this area.\n",
      "This is currently being tracked in  #741 \n",
      " How does this compare to other Python bindings of  llama.cpp ? \n",
      " I originally wrote this package for my own use with two goals in mind: \n",
      " \n",
      " Provide a simple process to install  llama.cpp  and access the full C API in  llama.h  from Python \n",
      " Provide a high-level Python API that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API so existing apps can be easily ported to use  llama.cpp \n",
